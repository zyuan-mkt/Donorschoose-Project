***Overall***

The accuracy of states with small education gap is lower than that of states with big education gap. And the overall lies between.

***['pos_sec','pos_pri','pos_prek','neg_sec','neg_pri','neg_prek']***

Positive words: language>science>others; prek>primary>secondary

***['neg_pre_b', 'neg_pre_s','neg_pri_b','neg_pri_s','pos_pre_b', 'pos_pre_s','pos_pri_b', 'pos_pri_s']***

Rich schools in states with small education difference have more positive words than those with big education difference. For poor schools, there is no systematic variation.

***['prek_lan', 'prek_sci','prek_oth','pri_lan', 'pri_sci', 'pri_oth','sec_lan', 'sec_sci', 'sec_oth']***
Nothing interesting

***['lan_pre_s', 'sci_pre_s', 'oth_pre_s','lan_pri_s', 'sci_pri_s', 'oth_pri_s', \
'lan_pre_b', 'sci_pre_b','oth_pre_b', 'lan_pri_b', 'sci_pri_b', 'oth_pri_b']***

For small difference states, poor schools use more nouns, less adjectives, less adverb, and less verb than rich schools.
For rich difference states, poor schools use less nouns, less adjectives, less adverb, and less verb than rich schools. -->
